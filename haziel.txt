this is hazzys

My role is backend.
I am responsible with dealing with the servers and json files of the project.
I worked on setting up the files, and and starting the scripts of setting up the req and res
for the server

Biggest challenge today was  setting up github and learning the commands.

My goals is to have the program functional to the mininum, then adding further content
for the users. Having a functional submit button for the JSON files is my current priority.
I will continue working on server side, making sure information is being sent to users.json

what did you accomplish today?
fixed some of the form.html

first task tommorrow?
move my stuff from form.html into login, so brock can work on his part of the project


10/3

do you beleive your giving your best effort to the team?
yes, I am trying. Even if it means mulitple errors on the servers, I'm still trying.

one way you hope to improve by end of the week?
functional login and sign up page, and hopefully get to help brock with his work too

one technical challenge that kept you from moving forward?
Understanding backend in a deeper level. It makes a little more sense now.

1 way to support your team?
giving better directions, better communitcation
What did you accomplish today?
fixed the signup, now it accepts users. started working on login, so that it'll only accept users from users.json file
