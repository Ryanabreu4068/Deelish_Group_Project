this is hazzys

My role is backend.
I am responsible with dealing with the servers and json files of the project.
I worked on setting up the files, and and starting the scripts of setting up the req and res
for the server

Biggest challenge today was  setting up github and learning the commands.

My goals is to have the program functional to the mininum, then adding further content
for the users. Having a functional submit button for the JSON files is my current priority.
I will continue working on server side, making sure information is being sent to users.json

what did you accomplish today?
fixed some of the form.html

first task tommorrow?
move my stuff from form.html into login, so brock can work on his part of the project


10/3
What did you accomplish today?
